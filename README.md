# calendar-condenser-ui

This is the UI for the [calendar-condenser](https://github.com/jakemingolla/calendar-condenser) project to test the UI <> Backend communication layer.

# ⚠️ This repository was 100% vibe coded using [cursor](https://www.cursor.com) ⚠️

The `App.tsx` file is where the sausage is made. There's a ton of random cruft acummulating in there, but it works enough for the demo!
